# 100-bit binary adder

Implementation of a 100-bit binary adder in C++, capable of adding two 100-bit numbers and a carry-in to produce a 100-bit sum and carry-out. This design demonstrates the fundamental concept of binary addition and the utilization of bitwise operations for arithmetic operations in digital systems.
