# 2-to-1 Multiplexer

Implementation of a 2-to-1 multiplexer (MUX), it directs one of two input signals, data0 and data1, to output based on the control signal, select. When select is low (0), the MUX relays data0 and when select is high (1), it transmits data1.

Work-in-progress, ostream implement needed.
