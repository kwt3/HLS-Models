# 3-Bit Ripple Carry Adder

A 3-bit binary ripple-carry adder constructed from multiple instances of a full adder, enabling the addition of two 3-bit numbers along with a carry-in to produce a 3-bit sum and carry-out. Demonstrates the sequential cascading of full adders to perform arithmetic operations in digital circuits.
