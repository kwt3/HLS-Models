# ALU Half adder-subtractor

<<<<<<< HEAD
Implementation of an ALU half adder-subtractor, a digital circuit enabling addition and subtraction of binary numbers. This design incorporates fundamental logic operations, including XOR and AND, to compute sum and carry outputs. Understanding the Half Adder Subtractor is essential for mastering digital arithmetic and sequential logic circuits.


## Header File

Add the alu.hpp file to the same folder as the test cases to run on Vitis HLS.

Test case(s) have been verified in Vitis HLS 2023.2.
=======
Work-in-progress, ALUs need to be renamed and add test cases for bool, int, ap_int, ap_uint need to be configured with ostream.
