# ALU Half adder-subtractor

Implementation of an ALU half adder-subtractor, a digital circuit enabling addition and subtraction of binary numbers. This design incorporates fundamental logic operations, including XOR and AND, to compute sum and carry outputs. Understanding the Half Adder Subtractor is essential for mastering digital arithmetic and sequential logic circuits.

# Verified test cases

alu_half_adder_bool

Test case(s) have been verified in Vitis HLS 2023.2.

## All other test cases

All other test cases are work in progress due to failing the cosimulation as ostream needs to be implemented.
