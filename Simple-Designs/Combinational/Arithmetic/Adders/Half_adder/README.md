# Half adder

Implementation of a half adder, a fundamental digital circuit that adds two bits without considering any carry-in, producing a sum and carry-out. This design showcases basic logic operations such as XOR and AND, fundamental to understanding digital arithmetic and circuit design

## Edit
Work-in-progress. More test cases still need to be added such as ap_int, ap_uint, int, and more.
