# Half adder

Implementation of a half adder, a fundamental digital circuit that adds two bits without considering any carry-in, producing a sum and carry-out. This design showcases basic logic operations such as XOR and AND, fundamental to understanding digital arithmetic and circuit design

## Test cases

Include cases for bool, ap_int<8>, & ap_uint<8>. Test case int, ap_int<16>, & ap_uint<16> needed.
