# Full adder

<<<<<<< HEAD
Implementation of a full adder, a fundamental digital circuit capable of adding three bits, including a carry-in, to produce a sum and carry-out. This design exemplifies the integration of basic logic operations such as XOR and AND, pivotal for understanding complex arithmetic operations and sequential logic circuits.

## Edit

Work-in-progress. Full adder needs to be its own file without half_adder OOP.
