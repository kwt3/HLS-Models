# Full adder

Creation of a full adder, a fundamental digital circuit capable of adding three bits, including a carry-in, to produce a sum and carry-out. This design exemplifies the integration of basic logic operations such as XOR and AND, pivotal for understanding complex arithmetic operations and sequential logic circuits.
