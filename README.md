# HLS Models

This repository is a collection of Vitis HLS Models from the community to aid in acquiring examples for machine learning purposes.

The folder called Simple Designs includes models such as basic sequential and combinational circuits that were synthesized in Vitis HLS.

Below are a list of publically available designs:
